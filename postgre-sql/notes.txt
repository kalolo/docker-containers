Build the image using:

$ docker build -t eg_sshd .


Run a test_sshd container
Then run it. You can then use docker port to find out what host port the container’s port 22 is mapped to:

$ docker run -d -P --name test_sshd eg_sshd
$ docker port test_sshd 22

0.0.0.0:49154
And now you can ssh as root on the container’s IP address (you can find it with docker inspect) or on port 49154 of the Docker daemon’s host IP address (ip address or ifconfig can tell you that) or localhost if on the Docker daemon host:

$ ssh root@192.168.1.2 -p 49154
# The password is ``screencast``.
root@f38c87f2a42d:/#


Clean up
Finally, clean up after your test by stopping and removing the container, and then removing the image.

$ docker container stop test_sshd
$ docker container rm test_sshd
$ docker image rm eg_sshd
